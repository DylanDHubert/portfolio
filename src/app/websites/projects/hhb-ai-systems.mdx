# HHB AI Systems

## Overview

HHB AI Systems is a collaborative project by Dylan Hubert, Luke Heitman, and Alex Bull, focused on building intelligent document processing pipelines and retrieval agents for complex, real-world data. Our systems leverage dynamic agents, semantic search, and advanced retrieval logic to make technical information accessible and actionable.

## Description

Our platform is designed to handle the messy reality of technical documents, enabling:
- Dynamic document parsing and enrichment
- Conversational retrieval agents (RAG)
- Semantic and context-aware search
- Domain-agnostic architecture for multiple industries

## Technologies Used
- Next.js, React, TypeScript
- Python, FastAPI
- OpenAI, Hugging Face, LlamaIndex
- Vector databases, Redis
- Docker, Vercel

## Future Enhancements
- More agentic workflows
- User-uploaded document support
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with more data sources
