# The Pants Project

## Overview

The Pants Project is an interactive visualization that explores the latent space of VGG-18 neural network when processing images of pants. Available at [thepantsproject.vercel.app](https://thepantsproject.vercel.app), this project creates a density map showing how different types of pants cluster in the high-dimensional feature space learned by the VGG-18 architecture.

## Problem Statement

I wanted to explore how neural networks understand and represent visual concepts, specifically focusing on:
- How do different types of pants cluster in neural network feature space?
- What patterns emerge when visualizing high-dimensional latent representations?
- How can we make abstract neural network concepts more tangible and interactive?
- What insights can we gain about the internal representations of computer vision models?

## Solution

I built The Pants Project to create an interactive exploration of neural network latent space:

### **VGG-18 Latent Space Analysis**
