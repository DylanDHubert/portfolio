# Eudaemonia

## Overview

Eudaemonia is a personal wellness tracking application built for my own use, available at [eudaemonia.vercel.app](https://eudaemonia.vercel.app). The app helps me monitor daily habits, track correlations with happiness and stress, and build gratitude practices through comprehensive tracking and analytics.

## Problem Statement

I wanted to track my own wellness data but found existing solutions lacking:
- No easy way to track multiple custom categories consistently
- Limited understanding of how daily habits affect my happiness and stress
- No built-in gratitude practices or reflection tools
